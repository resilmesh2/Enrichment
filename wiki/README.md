# Silent Push - Enrichment

## Introduction
This is a Silent Push Client API responsible for enriching events from the Resilmesh Framework.

Silent Push is a proprietary scanning and aggregation engine, using first-party data that logs changes across the entire IPv4 space, and provides security teams with pre-evaluated data and query functionality that simply isnâ€™t available anywhere else on the Internet.
**"We know first"**
